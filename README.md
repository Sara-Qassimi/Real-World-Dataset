# README

## Overview

This dataset is designed to enhance personalized learning experiences by providing detailed context about students and their interactions with various learning activities. It includes context features and corresponding actions (referred to as "arms") to tailor educational support and recommendations.

## Dataset Details

The dataset includes CSV files with data for 1,000 students. Each studentâ€™s information is detailed through 10 context features and is associated with 5 distinct actions (arms).

### Context Features

The dataset provides the following 10 context features:

-  Current Skill Level : Indicates the student's proficiency in different subjects or topics.
-  Recent Performance : Reflects the student's recent performance on assessments or exercises.
-  Engagement Level : Measures how engaged the student is with the learning material.
-  Time of Day : Records the time when the student interacts with the system, which can affect performance and engagement.
-  Preferred Learning Style : Indicates whether the student prefers visual, auditory, or kinesthetic learning materials.
-  Previous Activity Type : Details the type of learning activity the student engaged with last.
-  Learning Objective : Captures the current learning goal or objective the student is working towards.
-  Feedback Response : Shows how the student has responded to previous feedback.
-  Stress Level : Measures the student's current stress or frustration level.
-  External Factors : Includes factors such as environmental noise or interruptions that could impact learning.

### Actions (Arms)

The dataset includes 5 different actions (arms) that can be taken to support students:

-  Recommend Practice Problems : Suggests practice problems or exercises tailored to the student's current skill level.
-  Provide Hints : Offers hints or additional guidance to assist students in solving challenging problems.
-  Suggest Supplementary Resources : Recommends additional learning materials such as articles, videos, or interactive simulations.
-  Offer Feedback : Provides personalized feedback based on the student's recent performance.
-  Propose Study Strategies : Suggests effective study techniques, time management tips, or metacognitive strategies.

## Usage

To utilize this dataset:

1.  Upload CSV Files : You will need to upload two CSV files:
   -  Context Features CSV : Contains the context features for each of the 1,000 students.
   -  True Reward CSV : Contains the true reward data associated with the actions taken.

2.  Analysis and Integration : Use the context features to tailor actions and recommendations to individual students based on their specific needs. The true reward data can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of different actions and refine your recommendation strategies.

This dataset allows you to analyze and enhance personalized learning experiences by leveraging detailed student information and action outcomes.
